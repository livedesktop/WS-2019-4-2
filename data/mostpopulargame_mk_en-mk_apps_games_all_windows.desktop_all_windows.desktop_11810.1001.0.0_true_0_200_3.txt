This game is quite addictive, that's for sure because it is very popular. If you loved Peggle Montezuma, marble woka woka Zuma Deluxe or Zumas Temple Quest. It's about our version of the famous Zuma. For the once that are wondering what kind of game is Zuma, here is little explanation. You will see many colorful balls in the game and the scope of the game is actually very simple - you must join 3 balls with same color on the chain and destroy them. So it sounds very easy and yes, it is but not that easy because it asks for some strategic thinking in order to complete this task.\r\n\r\nAlso you get a chance to choose your playing mode. When you are still a beginner, choose the 'easy mode' but as you become more skilled, the 'hard mode' would be your bigger challenge.\r\n\r\nThe game consists of three levels, three different worlds that hide their own challenges. The first world is 'Amazon jungle', the second one is 'Ancient Ruins' while the third one takes you to the \"Frozen Land\".

Invading intergalactic chickens, out to punish humanity for our oppression of their earthly brethren.\r\n\r\n\"I instantly knew what had to be done. I dropped my half-eaten chicken burger and jumped in my cockpit. With a greasy finger I set my lasers to \"extra crispy\" and blasted off to intercept the fowl invaders.\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't easy. Squawks, feathers flying, the smell of charred chicken everywhere. Three times they invaded, each time with increasingly devious plans. Three times I managed to push them back whence they came, and secure humanity a few more years as the dominant species of this planet.\r\n\r\n\"After their last retreat, I headed for my local Space Burger to bask in the glow of my recent victory. Breathing a sigh of relief, I sat down to enjoy a double chicken-burger with crispy chicken wings on the side.\r\n\r\n\"Little did I know that my greatest adventure was yet to come...\"\r\n\r\n\"Ultimate Omelette\" is the title of the fourth episode in the Chicken Invaders series of casual space shooter games. The game puts players at the forefront of a battle against invading intergalactic chickens, bent on revenge against the human race for our oppression of Earth chickens. In this episode, the chickens have constructed a gigantic cannon capable of launching planet-scale eggs against Earth, with the ultimate goal of encrusting humanity in an impenetrable wall made of egg white. Joined by an unlikely ally, players will travel to foreign, unexplored galaxies in an effort to locate and destroy the egg cannon before it reaches Earth.\r\n\r\nThe enemy repertoire has been significantly broadened, introducing several different kinds of chickens which attack relentlessly in colorful groups and meticulously choreographed formations. The chicken fray is punctuated by fights against boss enemies spanning up to three times the size of the screen. The arsenal at the player's disposal has also been correspondingly extended, with three new weapons and four kinds of supporting satellites providing additional firepower. The player's intergalactic journey is also accentuated by unique fantastic scenarios, such as navigating through a field of gigantic floating feathers, or dodging molten planet chunks during a supernova explosion.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJB38","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"C.H.A.O.S Multiplayer Air War","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.40839.9007199266251997.6fff2387-d018-46d3-9615-6c48338460d8.e3646c1c-58cd-412d-ab2d-5fb9d79b4bb7","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.4313.9007199266251997.4a702b0a-e861-490d-902a-3f266205f001.f0ab9295-ec3b-41a1-a85e-32c50988c578","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["7635511E.C.H.A.O.SMultiplayerAirWar_4jpkmym17s56t"],"ContentIds":["00f57c08-b13b-ce4c-1a1b-5b2e0445ff11"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"This is realistic Combat helicopter assault operation simulator - short name C.H.A.O.S.\r\n\r\nIn C.H.A.O.S you will step into pilot's shoes and experience fierce air combats while flying one of the most hardcore helicopters in the world. \r\n\r\nEngaging in a dogfight against an attack helicopter may sound easily trivial on paper and in theory, but when it comes to reality...think again!\r\n\r\nA secret organization named C.H.A.O.S has been established by the dictators who lost their power and now they aim at world domination.

It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that very few hands are unsolvable. Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).\r\n\r\nA version of FreeCell was created by Microsoft for release with the Windows operating system.\r\n\r\nFreeCell solitaire is one kinds of funny solitaire card game, but it's not like other solitaires. You need no luck to win, only skill is required. All cards are opened from the start and the deal has the solution, you can win, think and move wisely. \r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n- deals with different difficulty \r\n- every completed deal has score \r\n- customizable background and card \r\n- magnetic card movement \r\n- supermove: multiple card dragging \r\n- drag or tap to move \r\n- undo option \r\n- optimized battery usage for very long gameplay \r\n\r\nRules\r\nConstruction and layout\r\nOne standard 52-card deck is used.\r\nThere are four open cells and four open foundations. Some alternate rules use between one to ten cells.\r\nCards are dealt into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. Some alternate rules will use between four to ten cascades.\r\n\r\nBuilding during play\r\nThe top card of each cascade begins a tableau.\r\nTableaux must be built down by alternating colors.\r\nFoundations are built up by suit.\r\n\r\nMoves\r\nAny cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.\r\nComplete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. Computer implementations often show this motion, but players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.\r\n\r\nVictory\r\nThe game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.\r\nVarious computer versions of Freecell occasionally deal unsolvable games.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nOne of the oldest ancestors of FreeCell is Eight Off. In the June 1968 edition of Scientific American, Martin Gardner described in his \"Mathematical Games\" column a game by C. L. Baker that is similar to FreeCell, except that cards on the tableau are built by suit rather than by alternate colors. Gardner wrote, \"The game was taught to Baker by his father, who in turn learned it from an Englishman during the 1920s.\" This variant is now called Baker's Game. FreeCell's origins may date back even further to 1945 and a Scandinavian game called Napoleon in St. Helena (not the game Napoleon at St. Helena, also known as Forty Thieves).\r\n\r\nPaul Alfille changed Baker's Game by making cards build according to alternate colors, thus creating FreeCell. He implemented the first computerised version of it in the TUTOR programming language for the PLATO educational computer system in 1978. Alfille was able to display easily recognizable graphical images of playing cards on the 512 * 512 monochrome display on the PLATO systems.\r\n\r\nThis original FreeCell environment allowed games with 4–10 columns and 1–10 cells in addition to the standard 8 * 4 game. For each variant, the program stored a ranked list of the players with the longest winning streaks. There was also a tournament system that allowed people to compete to win difficult hand-picked deals. Paul Alfille describes this early FreeCell environment in more detail in an interview from 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolver complexity\r\nThe FreeCell game has a constant number of cards. This implies that in constant time, a person or computer could list all of the possible moves from a given start configuration and discover a winning set of moves or, assuming the game cannot be solved, the lack thereof. To perform an interesting complexity analysis one must construct a generalized version of the FreeCell game with 4 * n cards. This generalized version of the game is NP-complete; it is unlikely that any algorithm more efficient than a brute-force search exists that can find solutions for arbitrary generalized FreeCell configurations.\r\n\r\nThere are 52! (i.e., 52 factorial), or approximately 8*1067, distinct deals. However, some games are effectively identical to others because suits assigned to cards are arbitrary or columns can be swapped. After taking these factors into account, there are approximately 1.75*1064 distinct games.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH6D051","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Hearts Pro","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13996.13510798886626384.07ad1649-6438-4916-ab22-470b227ad4f5.c0181a7a-749a-4fd9-a613-12080d13f9b7","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.268.13510798886626384.2ca288cd-0758-432b-8935-100969a9681f.80791239-a37b-4ebd-8b04-5438651c91ce","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10925.13510798886626384.c2c873b6-a5ed-4a3f-88b5-e500b007c1e7.8d8ba680-662c-4ec2-b45a-08e8510116de","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["ReflectionIT.HeartsPro_h3qw2m3pefnrp"],"ContentIds":["f7cacfe1-b52f-b5d0-3fd8-fa5a127f75eb","c84b934a-3b8b-bcdf-e95b-1e9876395329"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Play the best Hearts game on Windows Desktop and Mobile","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJ31L","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Spider Solitaire HD","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.59825.9007199266246027.0550894b-417c-4cb9-bcf5-4440144f70a6.6f6eb2f7-ee74-456c-adcd-ffbd5cd68910","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#962A95","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.33023.9007199266246027.cc1511ed-eb2d-472b-bf74-40de64426d88.01d655d8-f1d3-4dc2-8898-837051a5b18d","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#962A95","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63816.9007199266246027.49ec7d9c-a30a-4af7-9c59-1b6af71a78f6.4c222430-35d6-4bcc-b85a-7e77c56a254a","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#962A95","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["32988BernardoZamora.SpiderSolitaireHD_1fgex2kbsn6g8"],"ContentIds":["479ffce7-8364-5067-5bd4-de93271ed228","f17753ee-2876-18ca-297d-e2bb8b98da79","7972ec7a-2d9b-ca6b-fcc7-8205538a8e1f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"#1 Spider Solitaire -- 6,000,000 downloads, thank you!\r\n\r\nPlay the traditional patience game of Spider Solitaire you already know and love, no internet needed, just start and play.

In particular, you don't have to drag individual cards - drag&drop whole column, only proper cards will move the rest will snap back. The scoring all the games is simplified to track only number of moves to solve the puzzle. If you stuck, feel free to use hints or undo - implemented by all the games.

One of the Microsoft developers noticed this version and implemented a version for Windows. It was first included with Win32s as an application that enabled the testing of the 32-bit thunking layer (does anyone remember what that was?). FreeCell remained relatively obscure until it was released as part of Windows 95. \r\nSince then the game has been ported to numerous platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We largely tried to recreate a full experience of the game in a tiny download package, including power moves, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The cards will be moved to foundation automatically when possible. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better. \r\n\r\nOnly the top (exposed) card of each tableau pile is available for play. It may be moved to a foundation pile, a free cell, or to another tableau pile. Within the tableau, cards are built down in sequence and alternating in color. Any card may be moved into an empty space. Blocks of cards may not be moved, unless the requisite number of free cells and/or tableau spaces are available to allow each individual card to be moved. To move part of partial pile, drag whole pile - the game will self adjust. If you fill all four foundation piles, you win. \r\nIf you don't see any more moves try hints, undo (top right corner) to back track, or menu to start new game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

When this occurs, the opponent's discs that you have surround become yours.\r\n* If one player cannot make a valid move, the player must pass and the other player plays again.\r\n* The game is over when the entire board is filled or when no side can make a valid move.\r\n* The winner of the game is the one with the most discs when the game is over.\r\n\r\nNOTES: Ultima Reversi has an \"Auto Pass\" feature that automatically passes your turn if you have no other move available and must pass.\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NSHLQMC8K4H","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Marble Zumas 2","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19217.14367787726122684.fb13e00a-b337-45b9-ad10-1758ba753340.2a74b9c6-19b7-4723-9b46-b94871ae1fa4","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12322.14367787726122684.b91a02e6-8771-4977-ae1d-75bae068c048.655549e2-9346-463f-a8af-f29d0ca5c553","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19217.14367787726122684.fb13e00a-b337-45b9-ad10-1758ba753340.2a74b9c6-19b7-4723-9b46-b94871ae1fa4","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["5693VegasCasinoSlotsGames.MarbleZumas2_aty1q62km4q34"],"ContentIds":["c4270a8e-1d10-e54d-568c-4b4ced32b8c2","ae845c89-c095-8dd3-a141-c7c9d1826b81"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Marble Zumas is a brand new and amazing zuma puzzle game!\r\nFor the legendary treasure, you have to survive over six secret scenes in adventure mode.The idea comes from the passion bubble shooter game.

It’s the most popular ever happening games in many countries. \r\n\r\nLudo (from Latin ludo, \"I play\") is a strategy board game in which the players race their four tokens from start to finish according to rolls of a single die. \r\n\r\nLudo is derived from the Indian game Parchisi, but simpler. The game and its variants are popular in many countries and under various names.\r\n\r\nParchisi originated in India by the 6th century. \r\n\r\nEach player rolls the die; the highest roller begins the game. Players alternate turns in a clockwise direction.\r\n\r\nLudo can be played by two, three, or four, without partnerships. To enter a token into play from its yard to its starting square, a player must roll a 6. If the player has no tokens yet in play and rolls other than a 6, the turn passes to the next player. Once a player has one or more tokens in play, he selects a token and moves it forwards along the track the number of squares indicated by the dice. Players must always move a token according to the die value rolled. Passes are not allowed; if no move is possible, the turn moves to the next player.\r\n\r\nPlayers may not end their move on a square they already occupy. If the advance of a token ends on a square occupied by an opponent's token, the opponent token is returned to its owner's yard. The returned token can be reentered into play only when the owner rolls a 6. \r\n\r\nThe first person to move all 4 pieces into the home wins.\r\n\r\nHave you ever missed the classic family entertainment of the Ludo board that we used to play on as kids? \r\n\r\nWell now you can play Ludo Free with friends- the timeless game and enjoy it with your family and loved ones.\r\n\r\nSo why not make it a reality by playing this game and reliving your childhood days?\r\n\r\nDownload Ludo for free and recall your childhood!\r\n\r\n◆◆◆◆ Ludo Free Features ◆◆◆◆\r\n\r\n✔ 2, 3 or 4 player mode (Local co-op and Bots)\r\n✔ All time classic family ludo game\r\n✔ User friendly interface\r\n✔ Free to play\r\n\r\nPlease rate and give your feedback for Ludo Free for further improving the game.\r\n\r\nWe will be grateful to hear your opinions and improve -
